# stuomaskin
A Reddit theme made for /r/Kodi

I have tried to keep the theme at minimal, using as much as possible the original Reddit theme. If you find a feature that looks bad because of this, please let me know. I might have missed some more rare use-cases. I will clean up and comment the CSS more in case any interest is shown for the theme!

<b>Installation</b>

1. Copy the CSS from stuomaskin.css
2. Download the images (header.png, logo.png, sidebar.png, sticky.png, subicon.png) and keep their original names. (Reddit permits only uploaded images, no links)
3. Go to reddit.com/r/Kodi/about/stylesheet and paste the CSS into the editbox. Don't press save just yet
4. Below the stylesheet edit box, upload the images
5. Press save and you are done!

<b>Image sizes</b>

If you wish to change some of the images, the image sizes are as follows:

- Header: 1920x120
- Logo: 230x75
- Sidebar: 300x225 (4:3)
- Sticky: 50x50
- Subicon: 10x10


<i>Disclaimer: I don't own rights to any of the pictures. Kodi logo is a registered trademark, sidebar picture is probably too, header is made by me using a FanArt pictrure from http://addons.kodi.tv/show/resource.images.skinbackgrounds.clear/, i hope he doesn't mind. Sticky icon i made using Kodi's trademark logo, and subicon I made myself. I will remove the trademarked images from my repository after they are not needed here anymore. Now they are here for simplifying commissioning.</i>
