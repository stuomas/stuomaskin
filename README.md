# stuomaskin
A Reddit skin made for /r/Kodi

I have tried to keep the theme at minimal, using as much as possible the original Reddit theme. If you find a feature that looks bad because of this, please let me know. I might have missed some more rare use-cases. 

<b>Installation</b>

1. Copy the CSS from stuomaskin.css
2. Download the images (header.png, logo.png, sidebar.png, sticky.png, sub.png) and keep their original names
3. Go to reddit.com/r/Kodi/about/stylesheet and paste the CSS into the editbox. Don't press save just yet
4. Below the stylesheet edit box, upload the images
5. Press save and you are done!
