# stuomaskin
A Reddit theme made for /r/Kodi

I have tried to keep the theme at minimal, using as much as possible the original Reddit theme. If you find a feature that looks bad because of this, please let me know. I might have missed some more rare use-cases. I will clean up and comment the CSS more in case any interest is shown for the theme!

<b>Installation</b>

1. Copy the CSS from stuomaskin.css
2. Download the images (header.png, logo.png, sidebar.png, sticky.png, subicon.png) and keep their original names. (Reddit permits only uploaded images, no links)
3. Go to reddit.com/r/Kodi/about/stylesheet and paste the CSS into the editbox. Don't press save just yet
4. Below the stylesheet edit box, upload the images
5. Press save and you are done!

<b>Image sizes</b>

If you wish to change some of the images, the image sizes are as follows:

- Header: 1920x120
- Logo: 230x75
- Sidebar: 300x225 (4:3)
- Sticky: 50x50
- Subicon: 10x10


<b>Development</b>
I'm quite happy with the design, but the CSS is in some cases a bit hacky, what is of course sometimes needed when making stylesheets for a subreddit, but I'm working on cleaning it. If some CSS god want's to help, I'm happy to cooperate.



<b>Disclaimer</b>
I don't own rights to any of the pictures. Logo I made myself (idea stolen of course), sidebar picture is FanArt from Kodi forums, header I made myself using a FanArt pictrures from http://addons.kodi.tv/show/resource.images.skinbackgrounds.clear/. Sticky icon i made using Kodi's trademark logo, and subicon I made myself.
